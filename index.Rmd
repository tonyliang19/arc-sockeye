# Land acknowledgement

**I would like to acknowledge that I work on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations.**

*Traditional*: Traditionally used and/or occupied by Musqueam people

*Ancestral*: Recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation
