# Linux and CLI
.pull-left[
We will be using the .hand[famous] Linux system, where everything is going to be blacked out.

It is very cool once you are familiar at this.

`r pro` Command Line Interface (CLI)

`r con` Graphical User Interface (GUI)

.secondary[Useful CL commands]
```bash
cd ~/path/to/dir/
cp ~/file/to/copy.md file/to/paste.md
cp -r ~/dir/to/copy/ dir/to/paste
ls -a # list all files (including hidden)
rm ~/file/to/delete.txt
```

.your-turn[
How do you delete a directory then?
]

--

.emphasis[
rm -r ~/dir/to/delete 
]

The `-r` flag means to be done recursively. Many linux commands have this flag, in the case of `rm`, it remove directories and their contents recursively.

---

# Linux and CLI

Note, there are cases that you want to delete directories where files are protected (like those of **git**)

Use the following with **CAUTION**:

--

.alert[
.large[`rm -rf ~/dir/to/delete/gone_is_gone`]
]

--

The `-f` flag tells to delete .hand[force] without confirmation. Be very careful on what are you deleting. 

You likely don't want to contact admin:
> You: Hey, I think I have deleted my $HOME directory
>
> Admin: .......
>

---

# Linux and CLI

Most Linux commands have a built-in manual (man page) that serves as a quick guide to tell you what a command does. You could almost always type `command --help`.

Let's see an example
```bash
command --help
```

# How to connect

# Basic Information of Sockeye
